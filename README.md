## Motivation

The motivation for this project is to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to store/update/add/delete products in their database. Being provided the front-end code for this project, my main objective is to write the back-end code and create a connection between them.

In completing this project, I have learned the basic concepts of MySQL, Sequelize, and Express.js. I have also learned the benefits of utilizing modular routes to maintain cleaner code.
